I think the system is clear after you read the rules, and the way you connect numbers with color, position, and opacity makes sense.
But at first glance, it is not very easy to understand, and the code looks a little confusing without explanation.
I think a small chart, diagram, or example image would help people understand it faster.
You could also make the rules a bit simpler, or show which part is the most important.
Overall, it’s interesting, but it needs clearer guidance to make it easier to read.
